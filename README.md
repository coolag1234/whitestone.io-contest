whitestone.io contest submisison
===================

Not the most interesting work, but maybe rather an interesting story. Though I do have experience with Processing (see instagram.com/flowen_nl for some audioreactive visuals) I have never worked with THREE.js before, nor with webGL or the webAudio API.

I had no clue how to work with vertices, faces, geometry and such and was traveling with my girlfriend from Nepal to Bangladesh. While absorbing the culture shock, being delayed continuously (taxi’s failing to understand where to bring you), the idea of the contest would give me focus and energy to keep pursue’ing this. 

So I would say it’s a crazy learning-experience and I’ll definitely continue creating 3d in the browser and hopefully VR in the future as well :)

Special thanks to superGuiGui for this three.js.starterkit and the people in create-dev slack for answering my questions. 


After cloning install all node dependencies:
```bash
npm i
```

Then launch the main task to open budo livereload server:
```bash
npm start
```

to build the project:
```bash
npm run build
```


You are good to go !
